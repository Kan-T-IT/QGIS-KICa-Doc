# User Guide

## Welcome 
Welcome to the user manual of the QGIS plugin Kan Imagery Catalog, developed by Kan Territory & IT to consult availability of images in an area in an agnostic way, having as main objective to solve the need and not to focus on suppliers. In the beginning, satellite imagery providers (free and commercial) are incorporated, but it is planned to incorporate drone imagery among others.

## Purpose of the document
